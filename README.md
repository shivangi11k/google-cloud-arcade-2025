# Google Cloud Arcade 2025 Journey

This repository documents my learning journey through **Google Cloud Arcade 2025**.  
I’m using it to track labs, skill badges, and points in one place while building a public portfolio.

## Goals
- Strengthen Google Cloud fundamentals
- Earn Arcade points and skill badges
- Build a public record of my work

## Structure
- `labs/` → detailed notes per lab  
- `progress.md` → overall points, badges earned  
- `screenshots/` → proof of completion (optional)
